## Setup
1. Clone the repository
   1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
   2. Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the repository.
   3. Run the following command:
      ```
      git clone URL_of_the_repository
      ```

2. Check if the database is running
   1. MariaDB uses port 3306 by default. You can use a tool like `netstat` or `ss` to check if the database is running and listening on the default port:
      ```
      netstat -tuln | grep 3306
      or
      ss -tuln | grep 3306
      ```
   2. If the database is not running, you won't be able to proceed further.
   3. Create a database and the user.

[//]: # (3. Change the default MariaDB port &#40;optional&#41;)

[//]: # (   1. Windows: Edit the `my.ini` file in the MariaDB installation directory, typically `C:\Program Files\MariaDB X.Y\`. )

[//]: # (   2. Linux: Edit the `my.cnf` or `50-server.cnf` file in `/etc/mysql/` or `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/`. )

[//]: # (   3. macOS: Edit the `my.cnf` file in `/usr/local/etc/`.)

3. Run MariaDB SQL scripts to setup the database
   1. Navigate to the `mariadb_scripts` folder inside the cloned repository.
   2. Login to the MariaDB server as the root user or another user with necessary privileges:
      ```
      mysql -u root -p
      ```
   3. Enter your password when prompted.
   4. Execute following scripts:
      ```
      0_init.sql
      1_django_euf.sql
      ```
   5. Exit the MariaDB server by running:
      ```
      exit
      ```

[//]: # (   6. Run `generate_faker_data.py` from the terminal. It will take around half an hour to generate fake data using faker. It is optional, but it is required if you want to test how elastic search works for millions of records. You can modify this file as per your needs. Don't forget to fill in your database credentials in this file.)

[//]: # (   7. The database name, user, and password are mentioned in the `0_init.sql` file. Feel free to change it.)

4. Rename .env.sample to .env 
   1. Locate the .env.sample file in the project's root folder and rename it to .env. It will have a structure like this:
   2. You will use and edit this file later.

5. Generate Django secret key 
   1. Visit `https://djecrety.ir/` and click on the `Generate` button.
   2. You will get a unique secret key. Copy and paste it into the .env file where it says `DJANGO_SECRET`.
      ```
      DJANGO_SECRET=3n8$sb-qtudexj*da&*eyf87%-srom(od65y65%w)e!@5cn0gh
      ```
6. Set up database credentials
   1. Locate the `.env` file in the repository folder or create one if it does not exist.
   2. Set the environment variables as required, for example:
      ```
      MYSQL_USER=your_username
      MYSQL_DB=your_database
      MYSQL_PASS=your_password
      MYSQL_HOST=your_host
      MYSQL_PORT=your_port
      ```
   3. Save and close the file.

7. Set up SendGrid account and API key 
   1. Visit the SendGrid website at `https://sendgrid.com/` and sign up for a free account.
   2. Once you have created an account and logged in, navigate to the "API Keys" page in the dashboard, which can be found under "Settings" on the left-hand side menu.
   3. Click the "Create API Key" button at the top-right corner of the page.
   4. Give your API key a name and select the appropriate level of permissions (e.g., "Full Access" for complete control).
   5. Click the "Create \& View" button to generate your API key.
   6. Copy the API key to your clipboard, as it will not be shown again for security reasons.
   7. Open the .env file in your project folder with a text editor.
   8. Add a new line to the file to set the SendGrid API key environment variable, for example:
      ```
      EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_api_key
      DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_sendgrid_email
      EMAIL_HOST_USER=apikey
      EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
      EMAIL_PORT=587
      EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
      ```
   9. Replace your\_sendgrid\_api\_key and your\_sendgrid\_email with the actual API key you obtained from SendGrid and your SendGrid email address.
   10. Save and close the .env file.
   11. Note: Sometimes, SendGrid requires some additional verification. You'll have to provide the necessary information.

8. Setup Elasticsearch host, username, and password
   1. The credentials your created while setting up elasticsearch, enter them in the `.env` file

9. Install requirements
   1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
   2. Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:
      ```
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

10. Create database tables
    1. Once the database connection is established, run the following command from your project's root folder:
       ```
       python manage.py makemigrations
       python manage.py migrate
       ```

11. Creating a new superuser using django
    1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository.
    2. Run the following command to create a new superuser:
       ```
       python manage.py createsuperuser
       ```
    3. You will be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password for the new superuser. Provide the necessary information and confirm the password.
    4. Once the superuser is created, you can log in to your application using the new credentials.

12. Run the Django application
    1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository.
    2. Run the following command to start the Django application:
       ```
       python manage.py runserver
       or
       python manage.py runserver_plus
       ```
    3. By default, the Django application will run on IP address `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and port `8000`. You can access the application in your web browser by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

13. Change the default IP address and port (optional)
    1. If you want to run the Django application on a different IP address or port, you can provide the desired values as arguments when running the `runserver` command. For example, to run the application on IP address `192.168.1.2` and port `8080`, use the following command:
       ```
       python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.2:8080
       ```
    2. Access the application in your web browser by navigating to the specified IP address and port, for example, `http://192.168.1.2:8080`.

   
## Usage
1. By default, your website will run at:
```
http://localhost:8000/
```
2. Admin panel access (login with superuser credentials):
```
http://localhost:8000/admin/
```
3. Account access:
```
http://localhost:8000/account/login/?next=/
```
